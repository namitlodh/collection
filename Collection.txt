Collection Framework:
C# collections are made to more effectively organize, store, and modify comparable data. Adding, deleting, discovering, and inserting data into the collection are all examples of data manipulation. These classes support stacks, queues, lists, and hash tables. Most collection classes implement the same interfaces.

Data Structures
- Linear
- Non Linear

Time Complexity
-Assymptotic Notations
 -Big O(worst case)
 -Thetta (specific)
 -Omega (least cae)

Algorithms -brute force
           -sorting
           -searching
           -divide and conquer 
           -greedy
           -recursion
           -hashing
           -randomized
           -backtracking
           -dynamic programming
in for loops if more than 1 loops are present then loop with maximum iteration will be the time complexity of the program
it should be considered as the worst case complexity 
-------------------------------------------------------------

linear data structure:
elements will stored in a linear manner with squential memory allocation
-array
-linked list
-stack
-queue

non linear data structure:
-graph
-tree
 brute force complexity we not need to require time complexity 

divide and conquer
-merge sort
-binary sort

generic and non generic
.net-1.0
